# CIS4301 Project  

##About
This topic was selected because all the group members were passionate about the subject. Gaming is a unifying\
force that gained popularity during 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. When everyone was stuck at home,\
a vast majority of people had access to a computer with functional processing speed. With commute time reduced for\
many, there was free time opened up that allowed many to try new things such as baking, yoga, and gaming. Our app\
expands Steam's usability from the primary demographic of gamers and provides accessibility to anyone who wants\
to get into gaming and understand complex trends over periods of time as opposed to simply the most recent reviews.
