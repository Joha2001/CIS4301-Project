            Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. It was
            launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way
            for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded
            to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also
            expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront.
            Steam offers digital rights management (DRM), server hosting, video
            streaming, and social networking services. It also provides the user
            with installation and automatic updating of games, and community
            features such as friends lists and groups, cloud storage, and
            in-game voice and chat functionality.
