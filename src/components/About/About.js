          <p>that gained popularity during 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. When everyone was stuck at home,</p>
          <p>a vast majority of people had access to a computer with functional processing speed. With commute time</p>
          <p>for many reduced, there was a lot of free time open that allowed many to try new things such as baking,</p>
          <p>yoga, and gaming. Our app expands Steam usability from the primary focus being gamers to being accessible</p>
